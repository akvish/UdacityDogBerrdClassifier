As a part of Udacity Neural Networks Nano Degree I have completed the project on Dog Breed Classifier.
As part of this project,
  1. I have implememted a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) from scratch using Keras.
  2. I have created a CNN from existing VGG19 network using transfer learning in Keras.
